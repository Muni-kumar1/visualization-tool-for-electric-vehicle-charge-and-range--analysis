# visualization-tool-for-electric-vehicle-charge-and-range--analysis
Visualization Tool for Electric Vehicle Charge and Range Analysis is a data-driven project designed to analyze and visualize the performance of electric vehicles (EVs) with respect to charging behavior and driving range. The main objective of this project is to transform raw EV data into meaningful insights using interactive dashboards and visual analytics.

This project helps users understand key factors such as battery performance, charging patterns, energy consumption, and vehicle range. By using visualization techniques, the system makes complex EV data easy to interpret for students, researchers, manufacturers, and EV users.

The project integrates data collection, preprocessing, and visualization to present trends and comparisons between different electric vehicles. Interactive dashboards and storytelling tools (Tableau) are used to explore insights such as range variation, charging efficiency, and EV adoption patterns.

It also supports better decision-making by providing useful information for EV users, manufacturers, and researchers regarding battery usage, charging optimization, and performance evaluation.

Overall, this project demonstrates how data visualization and analytics can be applied to improve understanding of electric vehicle technology and promote efficient and sustainable transportation.
